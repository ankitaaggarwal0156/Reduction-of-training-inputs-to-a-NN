1. Program written for Python 2.7.
2. Prerequisites are that the libraries 'gurobipy', 'numpy' are available. 
3. Program directly cannot be run on Gurobi Python interface as the numpy library won't be available there. 
4. Program typically takes around 5 minutes to train the model and output the results. While training is in progress, timely messages are shown on the console.
5. The supporting text files downgesture_test.list, downgesture_train.list and the folder 'gestures' need to be present in same directory as the Python file.
6. Result is the predicted class for each of the test images, and the accuracy of prediction.

Sample output of the program is attached in "output.txt" file available in "Sample Output" directory
